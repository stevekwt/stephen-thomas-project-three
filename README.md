# The COVID Store

## A frontend-only eCommerce store built with jQuery

This is a mock-up of an eCommerce store that sells everything you might need in a 2020-era pandemic. It has a fully-functioning shopping cart that updates as you click. The page also updates the store's inventory count as you add items to your cart, to let you know exactly how few rolls of toilet paper are left!
